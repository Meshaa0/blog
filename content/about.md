In my recent role as an Assistant Design Manager at Reach First, I successfully collaborated with over 50 clients, overseeing the development of design improvement and assurance strategies. I managed and coordinated technically challenging projects, ensuring timely delivery and adherence to quality standards. With a background as a Senior Graphic Web Designer at Marketing on Wheels, I demonstrated effective communication skills, creativity, and problem-solving abilities, contributing to the successful realization of various projects.

Armed with AWS Cloud Practitioner and AWS Solutions Architect Associate certifications, my technical skill set includes proficiency in cloud architecture design, Infrastructure as Code (Terraform, CloudFormation), Serverless/Microservices architecture, and container orchestration (Docker/Kubernetes). I have successfully completed certificate courses in Kubernetes, Python, Terraform, and AWS, further enhancing my expertise.

Education-wise, I am pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Business Administration from the University of the People, with a noteworthy presence on the President's List. Additionally, I hold a diploma in Web Design and Graphic Design from Mesa College.

As a multilingual individual, I am a native Arabic speaker, achieved a 6-band score in the IELTS exam for English proficiency, conversant in Urdu, and currently engaged in learning the German language. Beyond my professional pursuits, my interests encompass gaming, reading, and a keen fascination with AI and Cloud Architecture.
