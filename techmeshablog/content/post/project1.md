Joining the excitement around Generative AI, AWS has introduced PartyRock, a fun tool in the Amazon Bedrock Playground. PartyRock is a no-code platform that lets anyone easily create Generative AI apps without hassle.

You can access PartyRock through any web browser, and it doesn't require an AWS account. Once you make your app, you can share it by generating a link and post it on social media using #partyrockplayground.

With PartyRock, you can personalize Generative AI models with your own data, making unique apps with text and images. The platform offers various models from top companies like Meta, Stability AI, AI21 Labs, Anthropic Cohere, and Amazon through a single API. Keep in mind that not all models are available yet.

In a nutshell, PartyRock lets you experiment, learn about prompt engineering, create small apps, and share them with friendsâ€”all without needing to code or set up an AWS account.

click Build your own app to get started. When you reach the app building screen, you'll be asked to describe what you want in your app. You have the option to start with a description for your app, or you can choose to begin with a completely empty app. Personally, I prefer the shortcut for my app, so I go with that!

My app (Full body workout Generator) is ready within a few seconds, and I enter some input to see if the output has sufficient snark for my needs. I click the Edit icon on the first widget, and see that it has a title, loading text, and a default value. The title allows widgets to reference each other by name

I have added another user input

Than, I use a text generation and I did call it meals

The finished app looks like this
