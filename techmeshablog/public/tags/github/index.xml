      <description>CI/CD stands for Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment is a simplified process that automates the different stages, such as building, testing and deploying, of developing software. As software is developed using CI/CD, developers guarantee that it is continuously left in a deployable condition. Changes in the code are integrated safely and as soon as feasible in this case in a practical setting. This development methodology shortens the development cycle while increasing the quality of the program in question by allowing for quick and often deployment.</description>
